- 👋 Hi, I’m Cameron
- 👀 I’m interested in the world (reality as it appears to us, or to me)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, I've made a start on C++ and JAvascript too, and I'd consider others. ALso langages, eg Swedish, Spanish and Chinese. And like.. what am I learning? I'm learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can maybe help with 
- 📫 How to reach me.. erm. If I discover this app doesn't have enough push notifications, I might have to write something here.
