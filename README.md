- 👋 Hi, I’m Cameron
- 👀 I’m interested in the world (reality as it emerges)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, I've made a start on C++ and Javascript too, and I'm considering others as well. Also natural langages, most recent additions are in Swedish, Spanish, and Chinese. But.. what am I learning? I'm learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I've posted, or anything I can maybe help with. decided "plucky programmer" is a good way of describing me. liable to bite off more than can chew, but let's see how we go
- 📫 How to reach me.. erm.. I'm new here - if it emerges that push notifications re messages is inadequate, I might add further details here...
